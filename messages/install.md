# KDL

Thank you for installing __KDL__!
(switch to Markdown via Command Palette's `Set Syntax: Markdown` for better reading experience and upvote this Package Control package's [issue](https://github.com/wbond/package_control/issues/238) to make Markdown rendering the default)

This package adds support for the [KDL](https://kdl.dev) document language (for files with `.kdl` extension)

To test it you can open any `KDL` file, for example, [syntax_example_screen.KDL](https://github.com/eugenesvk/sublime-kdl/blob/main/test/syntax_example_screen.kdl)[^1], and verify that the selected syntax is `KDL` and KDL-specific contexts are properly scoped and highlighted, maybe like so (depending on your color scheme)[^2]:

A more detailed overview is available at the [GitHub package page](https://github.com/eugenesvk/sublime-kdl), where you can also report üêûbugs or provide any other feedback via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/eugenesvk/sublime-kdl/issues)

[^1]: this example file is also included in this package locally, but you'd need to install [PackageResourceViewer](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/PackageResourceViewer) to conveniently extract it
[^2]: you can install the [Markdown Images](https://github.com/xsleonard/sublime-MarkdownImages) package to render images inside this file via Command Palette's `MarkdownImages: Show Remote Images`
